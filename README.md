ASGTECHNOLOGIESLTD WEBSITE
This project is a website that is useful to host online courses. I have developed this on the name of the company ASG Technologies ltd. This website contains details of courses. It also contains different information regarding the company objectives. The website is primarily designed for four purposes.
i.	Website request
ii.	Android application request
iii.	Technical courses
iv.	Digital posters

Inside the technical courses option, there are different technical courses available to register. Under every course a register button is available. On clicking register buttons the page will be redirected to the payment page of Instamojo (An external payment website).
The project also contains syllabus page, contact details page. Syllabus button is useful to see the syllabus of the page. Contact details button shows the contact details of the company.

Future possible updates:
1.	We can add login and register system.
